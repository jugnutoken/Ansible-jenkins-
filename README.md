<h1>Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS</h1>

<h4>This repository provides a comprehensive Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup utilizing Ansible, Docker, and Github Webhooks, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</h4>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h4>"In modern software development, there are two important things we do to make sure our apps get out quickly and work well: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). These practices help us quickly and reliably deliver our apps. </h4>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h4>Automated Deployment  :   This process makes it so that once we write some code and save it, that code gets automatically sent to where it needs to go, like putting it on a website, without needing someone to do it by hand every time. This helps keep everything the same across different places where we put our code.

<h4>Github Webhooks Integration   :  When we make changes to our code on GitHub, a tool called GitHub Webhooks tells another tool called Jenkins to start doing its job. Jenkins then automatically builds and puts our code where it needs to go, every time we change something.</h4>

<h4>AWS Deployment: The entire pipeline is deployed on AWS, leveraging its scalability, reliability, and elasticity.</h4>


<h1>Components</h1>

<h2>Jenkins:</h2> 
<h4>Jenkins is like the conductor of an orchestra, making sure everything in our software development process runs smoothly. It takes care of putting our code together, testing it, and getting it ready to go live .</h4>


<h2>Ansible:</h2>
<h4>Think of Ansible as the handyman who sets up and organizes everything we need on our cloud platform, AWS. It ensures that all the parts of our digital world are set up correctly and work together smoothly. </h4>


<h2>Docker:</h2> 
<h4> Docker is like a magic box where we put our applications and all the stuff they need to run. It keeps everything neat and tidy, making sure our apps run the same no matter where they are. .</h4>


<h2>Github Webhooks:</h2>
<h4>These are like little messengers that tell Jenkins whenever something new happens with our code on GitHub. They make sure Jenkins knows when to start working on our code automatically.</h4>



<h2>AWS:</h2>
<h4>The entire setup is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for virtual servers, VPC for networking, and IAM for access management.</h4>


<h1>Usage</h1>

<h4>1.Push your code changes to the Github repository.</h4>
<h4>2.Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline.</h4>
<h4>3.Jenkins executes the pipeline steps, including building, testing, and deploying the application.</h4>
<h4>4.Monitor the pipeline execution and check the deployment status on the Jenkins dashboard.
