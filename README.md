<h1>Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS</h1>

<h4>This repository provides a comprehensive Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup utilizing Ansible, Docker, and Github Webhooks, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</h4>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h4>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of applications. This project integrates Jenkins, a powerful automation server, with Ansible for configuration management, Docker for containerization, and Github Webhooks for seamless integration with version control.</h4>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h4>Automated Deployment: The pipeline automates the deployment process from code commit to production, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency across environments.


<h4>Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Ansible is used for provisioning and configuring infrastructure on AWS, enabling the setup of servers, networking, and other resources as code.</h4>

<h4>Containerization: Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.</h4>

<h4>Github Webhooks Integration: Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline upon code changes, enabling automatic builds and deployments upon every commit.</h4>

<h4>AWS Deployment: The entire pipeline is deployed on AWS, leveraging its scalability, reliability, and elasticity.</h4>


<h1>Components</h1>

<h2>Jenkins:</h2> 
<h4>Jenkins serves as the automation server orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline. It handles code integration, building, testing, and deployment.</h4>


<h2>Ansible:</h2>
<h4>Ansible automates the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure on AWS. It ensures that the required environment is set up consistently.</h4>


<h2>Docker:</h2> 
<h4>Docker is used for containerization, packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. This ensures that applications run consistently across different environments.</h4>


<h2>Github Webhooks:</h2>
<h4>Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline upon every code push or pull request, automating the build and deployment process.</h4>



<h2>AWS:</h2>
<h4>The entire setup is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for virtual servers, VPC for networking, and IAM for access management.</h4>


<h1>Usage</h1>

<h4>1.Push your code changes to the Github repository.</h4>
<h4>2.Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline.</h4>
<h4>3.Jenkins executes the pipeline steps, including building, testing, and deploying the application.</h4>
<h4>4.Monitor the pipeline execution and check the deployment status on the Jenkins dashboard.
