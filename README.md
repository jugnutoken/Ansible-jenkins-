<h1>Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS</h1>

<h4>This repository provides a comprehensive Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup utilizing Ansible, Docker, and Github Webhooks, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</h4>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h4>"In modern software development, there are two important things we do to make sure our apps get out quickly and work well: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). These practices help us quickly and reliably deliver our apps. </h4>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h4>Automated Deployment  :   This process makes it so that once we write some code and save it, that code gets automatically sent to where it needs to go, like putting it on a website, without needing someone to do it by hand every time. This helps keep everything the same across different places where we put our code.

<h4>Github Webhooks Integration   :  When we make changes to our code on GitHub, a tool called GitHub Webhooks tells another tool called Jenkins to start doing its job. Jenkins then automatically builds and puts our code where it needs to go, every time we change something.</h4>

<h4>AWS Deployment: The entire pipeline is deployed on AWS, leveraging its scalability, reliability, and elasticity.</h4>


<h1>Components</h1>

<h2>Jenkins:</h2> 
<h4>Jenkins serves as the automation server orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline. It handles code integration, building, testing, and deployment.</h4>


<h2>Ansible:</h2>
<h4>Ansible automates the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure on AWS. It ensures that the required environment is set up consistently.</h4>


<h2>Docker:</h2> 
<h4>Docker is used for containerization, packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. This ensures that applications run consistently across different environments.</h4>


<h2>Github Webhooks:</h2>
<h4>Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline upon every code push or pull request, automating the build and deployment process.</h4>



<h2>AWS:</h2>
<h4>The entire setup is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for virtual servers, VPC for networking, and IAM for access management.</h4>


<h1>Usage</h1>

<h4>1.Push your code changes to the Github repository.</h4>
<h4>2.Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline.</h4>
<h4>3.Jenkins executes the pipeline steps, including building, testing, and deploying the application.</h4>
<h4>4.Monitor the pipeline execution and check the deployment status on the Jenkins dashboard.
