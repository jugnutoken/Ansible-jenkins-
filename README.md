<h1>Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS</h1>

<h4>This repository provides a comprehensive Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup utilizing Ansible, Docker, and Github Webhooks, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</h4>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<h4>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of applications. This project integrates Jenkins, a powerful automation server, with Ansible for configuration management, Docker for containerization, and Github Webhooks for seamless integration with version control.</h4>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h4>Automated Deployment: The pipeline automates the deployment process from code commit to production, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency across environments.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Ansible is used for provisioning and configuring infrastructure on AWS, enabling the setup of servers, networking, and other resources as code.

Containerization: Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.

Github Webhooks Integration: Github Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline upon code changes, enabling automatic builds and deployments upon every commit.

AWS Deployment: The entire pipeline is deployed on AWS, leveraging its scalability, reliability, and elasticity.</h4>
